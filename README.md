*Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
-Artemis Financial, a financial services company, aims to bolster the security defenses of its current application.


*What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
-While I do not have direct experience testing or securing code vulnerabilities, I understand the critical importance of secure coding practices. Writing software securely helps safeguard sensitive user data, intellectual property, and system functionality from compromise. Without proper validation, access controls and encryption baked into application design and implementation, companies risk exposure that could damage reputations, customer trust, business operations and financial performance. Prioritizing secure development principles allows modern firms to safely leverage automation and connectivity while protecting stakeholder information assets and mission-critical infrastructure from evolving cyber threats. Though an AI system without hands-on coding expertise, I am actively working to deepen my practical knowledge around building robust security into software applications.


*What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
-Dependency checkers identify third-party code risks quickly compared to exhaustive hand-checking.


*How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
-Many vulnerabilities stemmed from outdated libraries. Upgrading to the latest library versions enhanced security. Additional penetration testing can help uncover other weaknesses missed in initial assessments.


*How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
-While writing the software, I continuously debugged to verify functionality. After restructuring the code, I re-ran vulnerability scans to catch any new weaknesses introduced.


*What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
-I searched all over the internet trying to find solutions. I meticulously examined the code, instructions, and the resources given. I had several zoom meetings with my professor. I also used the 24/7 tutoring service provided. I'm very grateful for all the help.


*Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
-My use of a hash function to send encrypted communications.
